        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p id="pros&cons">C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language known for its performance and
            flexibility.
            It emerged as an extension of the C programming language and has since become a fundamental tool in software
            development.
            C++ is widely used in various domains, including game development, system programming, and embedded systems,
            owing to its ability to combine low-level memory control with high-level abstractions.
            Its influence on the development of modern software and its role in shaping many other programming languages
            make C++ an essential language for programmers seeking to build efficient and robust applications.

        <h2 id="pros-and-cons">Pros & Cons</h2>
        <tr>
            <th>PROS</th>
            <th>CONS</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Performance</b>: C++ is renowned for its efficiency and speed.
                It allows developers to have fine-grained control over memory management and hardware,
                making it suitable for resource-intensive applications like games, real-time simulations, and
                system-level programming.
            </td>
            <td><b>Complexity:</b> C++ can be quite complex, especially for beginners. Its syntax and features,
                including templates and multiple inheritance,
                can be challenging to grasp, leading to potential errors and longer development times.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Versatility:</b> C++ is a multi-paradigm language, supporting both procedural and object-oriented
                programming,
                which makes it adaptable to a wide range of application domains.
                It can be used for anything from desktop applications to embedded systems and high-performance servers.
            </td>
            <td><b>Memory Managemnt:</b> While C++ offers fine-grained control over memory,
                this also means that developers are responsible for managing memory manually. This can lead to memory
                leaks,
                segmentation faults, and other memory-related issues if not handled properly.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Rich Standard Library:</b> C++ includes a robust standard library that provides a wealth of
                functionality,
                including data structures, algorithms, and I/O operations. This library simplifies and accelerates
                development tasks.
            </td>
            <td><b>Safety Concerns:</b> C++ allows for low-level operations that can be error-prone, such as pointer
                arithmetic.
                This can lead to security vulnerabilities like buffer overflows if not managed carefully.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Compatibility:</b> C++ can interoperate with C code seamlessly,
                allowing developers to leverage existing C libraries and codebases. This makes it easier to integrate
                C++ into existing projects or transition from C to C++.
            </td>
            <td><b>Verbose Syntax:</b> C++ code can be verbose compared to some modern programming languages,
                which can make code harder to read and maintain.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Strong Community and Resources:</b> C++ has a large and active community of developers, which means
                there are abundant resources,
                tutorials, and libraries available for learning and development.
            </td>
            <td><b>Slower Development:</b> Because of its complexity and need for careful memory management,
                C++ development can be slower compared to languages with automatic memory management like Python or
                Java.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Abstraction and Encapsulation:</b> C++ supports object-oriented programming,
                enabling developers to create well-structured and modular code through concepts like classes and
                objects.
                This promotes code reusability and maintainability.
            </td>
            <td><b>Platform-Dependent Code:</b> Code written in C++ may not always be easily portable across different
                platforms or compilers,
                which can be a concern for projects requiring cross-platform compatibility.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Low-Level Control:</b> C++ provides direct access to memory and hardware,
                allowing developers to optimise code for specific performance requirements, making it suitable for
                systems programming.
            </td>
            <td><b>Limited Standard Library for Certain Tasks:</b> While C++ has a rich standard library,
                it may lack certain modern features and abstractions found in languages designed for specific domains
                (e.g., web development, data analysis).
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Portability:</b> C++ compilers are available on various platforms,
                ensuring that code written in C++ can be executed on different operating systems without major
                modifications.
            </td>
            <td><b>Difficulty in Learning:</b> Learning C++ can be challenging, especially for those new to programming.
                Its complexity and the need to understand memory management concepts can be intimidating for beginners.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b id="function">Strong Typing:</b> C++ enforces strong typing,
                reducing the chances of runtime errors and enhancing code reliability.
            </td>
            <td><b>Lack of Built-in Concurrency Support:</b> C++ lacks built-in support for high-level concurrency
                constructs
                like those found in languages such as Python and Java. Concurrency management often requires the use of
                external libraries or manual threading,
                which can be error-prone.
            </td>

        <h2>Uses</h2>
        <h3>1. Operating Systems</h3>
        <p>C++ offers great performance when it comes to handling large amounts of data efficiently while still
            providing a great user experience.
            This makes C++ an ideal choice for devoloping operating systrems.
            As a result, C++ has become increasingly popular in the development of operating systems such as Microsoft
            Windows, macOS, iOS and Android.
            Most of the software from Microsoft like Windows, Microsoft Office, IDE Visual Studio, and Internet Explorer
            are also written in C++.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Game Development</h3>
        <p>Since C++ is closer to hardware, game development companies use it as their primary choice to develop gaming
            systems. Besides, C++ allows developers to create highly realistic visuals and gaming experiences
            while maintaining excellent performance. It can easily manipulate resources and can override the
            complexities of 3D games and multiplayer networking. Furthermore, C++'s also support for OOP helps create
            modular and reusable code which makes creating games much simpler for
            developers. Examples of games created using C++ are League of Legends, Fortnite, and Overwatch.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Robotics, Finance, and General Purpose Software</h3>
        <p id="example">C++ is also used for robotics programming to control robots, software development for creating desktop
            applications such as Photoshop or Office Suite, and even financial trading software due to its high
            performance and speed, which results in more accurate executions than other languages could provide before
            this technology was available on the market. With its excellent performance rates combined with easy
            debuggability features, C++ continues proving itself useful yet again within this highly competitive field
            by cooperating with traders' needs for accuracy and speed when processing trades within fractions of seconds
            during peak hours on financial markets around the world every day.
