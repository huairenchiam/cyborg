            <h1>Python</h1>
            <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. 
            It is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
            Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[37] Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. 
            Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2. </p>

            <th>Pros</th>
            <th>Cons</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span>Readability and Simplicity:</span> Python is known for its clean and easily readable syntax. Its use of indentation to define code blocks enforces a consistent and easily understandable coding style. This readability makes Python an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced developers.</td>
            <td><span>Performance :</span> Python is an interpreted language, which means it can be slower than compiled languages like C++ or Java, especially for CPU-intensive tasks. This performance limitation can be a drawback for applications that require high-speed processing or low-level system access</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span>Extensive Standard Library:</span> Python comes with a comprehensive standard library that provides a wide range of built-in modules and functions. This vast collection of libraries simplifies many common programming tasks, saving developers time and effort.</td>
            <td><span>Global Interpreter Lock (GIL):</span> In the CPython implementation (the default and most widely used Python interpreter), there's a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) that can limit the execution of multiple threads concurrently. This can impact the performance of multi-threaded Python programs and may require workarounds or the use of processes instead of threads for parallelism.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span>Versatility:</span> Python is a versatile language that can be used for a wide variety of applications, including web development, data analysis, scientific computing, machine learning, automation, and more. Its adaptability allows developers to work on diverse projects without needing to learn entirely new languages.</td>
            <td><span>Mobile App Development:</span> Python is not the first choice for mobile app development. While there are frameworks like Kivy and BeeWare that allow you to build mobile apps using Python, languages like Swift (for iOS) and Java/Kotlin (for Android) are more commonly used for native mobile app development.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Large and Active Community: Python boasts a large and active community of developers. This means that there is a wealth of online resources, forums, and third-party libraries available, making it easy to find solutions to problems, ask questions, and collaborate with others.</td>
            <td>Less Suitable for CPU-Bound Tasks: Python is well-suited for I/O-bound and high-level tasks but may not be the best choice for CPU-bound tasks due to its performance limitations. For CPU-bound operations, you may need to use other languages or utilize Python extensions written in languages like C.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Cross-Platform Compatibility: Python is available on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and more. This cross-platform compatibility ensures that code written in Python can run on various operating systems with minimal or no modifications, increasing its portability.</td>
            <td>Global Version Compatibility (Python 2 vs. Python 3): The transition from Python 2 to Python 3 posed challenges for developers, as the two versions were not fully compatible. Python 2 reached its end of life in January 2020, but legacy code written in Python 2 may still require migration efforts. However, this issue is becoming less relevant as more projects have migrated to Python 3</td>
